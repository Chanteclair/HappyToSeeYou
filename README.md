HappyToSeeYou
=============

Also potentially called, "Thank You For Being A Friend". 

The steps needed to create the project, at the time of writing this (before I have actually tried), include: 

1. Take a celebrity's face- in my case it would be from one of the following: James Franco, Bea Arthur or Angela Lansbury.
2. Take this lifesized photo and stick it onto carboard. On the back of this cardboard is a magnet.
3. Fill the celebrity's eyes and mouth with LEDs, ideally multi-colored. 
4. Connect the LEDs to the Arduino, add a motion sensor to it. Stick this motion sensor somewhere to the back of the magnet.
5. Figure out the code. :/

The User will:

1. Stick the celebrity's (in this case James Franco) face onto a space that they frequently use: locker, fridge, TV, next to your desk, your piano/keyboard, next to your bed. 
2. When you get close to it, the celebrity's eyes and mouth light up- they are happy to see the User! The User will never be lonely again. 

Happy To See You Has MANY inflences:

Eye Pillows- Amy Sedaris.

Just over  a year ago, I was involved in a bike accident. I spent a year in my apartment recovering from a mild brain injury. Previously nicknamed 'Complicated Katie' by my best friend, I was now domestic and unable to focus on intellectual affairs. A friend lent me her copy of Amy Sedaris' 2010 book, Simple Times: Crafts for Poor People. http://www.amysedarisrocks.com/simpletimes/

I soon began making eyepillows for friends using tights, beans, vanilla and buttons. 



Bridget Moser is a Toronto-based performance artist. Her 2008 video, "Young Forever", reappropriates Mischa Barton's face in a cutout. She reenacts a scene from the O.C. in a disturbing way that I love. Makeup, an iPod, blood and flour come out of her mouth while her boyfriend waxes on about his adolescent melodrama.

I like the idea of a “Sensitive Object”, something that can pick up on your moods and cheer you up. Happy To See You gives you the illusion that someone understands how the User feels and can play off it.  

I recently began following actor James Franco on Instagram- instagram.com/jamesfrancotv
He is dreamy!

During my year of seclusion, I spent an inordinate amount of time watching the Golden Girls and Murder, She Wrote. As a result, I feel a strong kinship to Bea Arthur and Angela Lansbury.

Magnet to put in your locker, on your fridge, piano, TV, Desk, to keep you company when you get home. 

Now it’s just lights, but I would like to add music-- maybe the theme song from the Golden Girls, Murder, She Wrote, or the theme song to Tetris. 

I love kitsch; Pee Wee Herman has always been a major inspiration. 

Can custom make them for ex boyfriends and such. 

Could sell it at kitschy toy stores for maybe around $60. 

Facial recognition things that I used in Avi.
